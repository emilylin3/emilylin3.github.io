I am currently a graduate student at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://mit.edu) working towards a joint Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering (CSE) under the guidance of Prof. Evelyn Wang (at the [Device Research Lab](https://drl.mit.edu/)) and Prof. Sili Deng (at the [Deng Energy and Nanotechnology Group](https://deng.mit.edu/)). My research focuses on developing physically-interpretable machine learning models for accelerating atomistic simulations, like Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently applying them to real-world materials problems *via* both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. 

Prior to my Ph.D. work, I completed my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at MIT, focusing mainly on the end-to-end development (design, build, test, and integration) of controllable, energy-dense catalytic micro-combustors for portable devices (specifically atmospheric water harvesters [AWH]). Our team successfully demonstrated the AWH's cyclic water generation capabilities during rigorous, environmentally-controlled testing. Before entering MIT, I also completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering (with a minor in Aerospace Engineering) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) with highest honors. 

I am also currently pursuing an internship at Bristol Myers Squibb as a machine learning intern in the Informatics and Predictive Sciences (IPS) division, specifically, in the Oncology & Protein Homeostasis team, where I am working on (1) benchmarking/finetuning generative models for drug discovery, and (2) developing a geometric deep learning model for binding interface predictions. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, hiking, biking, and trying to improve my German.
