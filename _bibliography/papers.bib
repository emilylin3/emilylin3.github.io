abstract = {The increasing demand for low-cost, high energy density heat sources has motivated the development of compact and lightweight combustion-based devices. In this work, we developed an energy-dense (≈236 MW/m3) entrainment-based catalytic micro-combustor for heating portable systems. The multichannel micro-combustor (coated with Pt/Al2O3 catalyst) leverages a copper-nichrome wire to enable quick and localized ohmic preheating durations (2–3 mins). Furthermore, we demonstrated low ignition temperature (108–125 °C), which facilitates low energy consumption (∼1948 J). In addition, an optimal fuel flow rate (3.09 × 10-8 m3/s) was determined via FEM simulations and experiments to enable fuel savings (high fuel conversion) while achieving high heat fluxes by analyzing the reaction kinetics and species transport behavior in the microchannels. Through independent testing, we established the micro-combustor’s ability to maintain long-term autothermal combustion at a high saturation wall temperature (585 °C), which was attained at short timescales to enable fast heating/cooling cyclability. The successful cyclic heating demonstration of large thermal mass additions (at least 41 times the micro-combustor’s mass), coupled with the combustor’s high energy density, shows promise for device-level implementation for a range of commercial, defense, and energy conversion applications.}

abstract = {A recent prioritization of energy-efficient and sustainable technologies has fueled an ongoing demand for improving the heat sources necessary to drive thermally dependent processes in portable and small-scale devices. Previous efforts have explored hydrocarbon-based catalytic combustion (and its kinetics and fuel usage efficiency) for reliable heating in microscale devices (TPVs, TEGs, etc.). However, for mesoscale systems that require a larger length scale combustor, fuel management and the ability to maintain consistent heat flux across the combustor become challenging due to kinetics and mass diffusion limitations, which are extrinsic to microscale combustors. In this work, we present the design and experimental evaluation of a compact parallel plate catalytic micro-combustor with non-uniform, segmented catalytic zones that allow for direct control of heating, spatially. Specifically, we performed a comparative FEM study of various catalyst segmentation patterns to further optimize catalyst bed spacing for decreased fuel consumption and improved combustion reaction kinetics. Due to these enhancements, the proposed patterning scheme can achieve similar temperature profiles to those of a fully-coated surface while using 77.8% less catalyst and reducing extreme thermal gradients during the early transient combustion phase. Finally, we demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed catalytic combustor by testing the combustor in a controlled environment.}

abstract = {The large design space of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has prompted the utilization of deep learning to drive material design. Nonetheless, the prediction of key thermodynamic properties, such as heat of adsorption (ΔH<sub>ads</sub>), remains largely unexplored for CO2 adsorption in MOFs. Herein, we present IsothermNet, a high-throughput graph neural network designed to estimate uptake and ΔH<sub>ads</sub> over 0–50 bars, enabling high-quality full isotherm reconstruction (PCC: 0.73–0.95 [uptake], 0.76–0.88 [ΔH<sub>ads</sub>]). We further bridged these adsorption properties to uptake behaviors (i.e., isotherm shapes/types) and structural information by performing detailed ablation studies to investigate the relative importance of local and global features in relation to predictive performance. This comparative analysis facilitated the discovery of a (1) physically-interpretable and (2) analytically-derived universal descriptor set capable of illustrating interdependencies between easily-computed, accessible textural information and extrinsic adsorption properties. When used cooperatively with IsothermNet, these descriptors enable efficient material screening, accelerating high-performance MOF discovery for CO2 capture.}
