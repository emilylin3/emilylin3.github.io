We further explored mechanisms to increase fuel savings by demonstrating on a lab-scale, single-channel parallel-plate reactor. We found that we could save significant amounts of catalyst while simultaneously improving reaction kinetics for catalytic micro-combustors via non-uniform catalyst segmentation at the combustor surface. We were able to enhance downstream fuel distribution and maximize fuel conversion efficiency for high-aspect ratio catalytic combustors by optimizing the patterning to reduce fuel consumption and localized heating at the entrance. Ultimately, this new pattern yields large catalyst savings (77.8%) while achieving high temperatures  {% cite LIN2023146627 %}.
