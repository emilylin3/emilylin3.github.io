We developed energy-dense, entrainment-driven, catalytic microcombustors that are suitable for portable devices, like atmospheric water harvesters (AWH). We designed each component of these combustors, from the microchannels and ohmic heaters to the entrainment manifold, performing various ablation studies to tune the combustor parameters and ultimately improve fuel savings and reaction rates/fuel conversion efficiency, as governed by kinetics/transport in the channels. We fabricated the microcombustors and subsequently performed cycling tests to demonstrate ultra-high thermal mass heating (>41 times its own mass). These combustors are then integrated into an in-house AWH device, along with proper controls *via* Arduino, to drive the desorption cycles in the water production process. We successfully demonstrated the combustors' and device's performance during rigorous, controlled testing in an environmental chamber (from ambient temperatures as low as 1.7°C to as high as 43.3°C) {% cite LIN2023117014 %}.

We further explored mechanisms to increase fuel savings by demonstrating on a lab-scale, single-channel parallel-plate reactor. We found that we could save significant amounts of catalyst while simultaneously improving reaction kinetics for catalytic micro-combustors via non-uniform catalyst segmentation at the combustor surface. We were able to enhance downstream fuel distribution and maximize fuel conversion efficiency for high-aspect ratio catalytic combustors by optimizing the patterning to reduce fuel consumption and localized heating at the entrance. Ultimately, this new pattern yields large catalyst savings (77.8%) while achieving high temperatures  {% cite LIN2023146627 %}.
